Hello and welcome to my google apps map!

I am happy to share with you my project.

There are 7 markers in total but because of the zoom in function there is only one displayed.

I hope this is not too big of an inconvience.

When you click on one of the preselected markers, a new window shows up with a Hello World message.

Best Regards
Diart
